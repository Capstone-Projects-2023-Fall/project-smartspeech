# Sequence Diagrams

## Use Case 1: *Drawing Recognition* - Drawing is Recognized
**User wants to draw a picture to help them communicate, and it is recognized in the top options.**

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    actor U as User
    participant C as Canvas
    participant T as Tiles
    participant RH as RecognizeHandler
    participant AR as Amazon Rekognition

    activate C
    activate T
    
    loop while drawing
        U->>C: Draws
        C->>RH: Automatically Sends drawing
        activate RH
        RH->>+AR: Sends drawing
        AR->>AR: Recognizes drawing
        AR-->>-RH: Suggests objects
        RH-->>T: Displays suggestions
        deactivate RH
    end
    
    U->>T: Presses suggestion
    T-->>U: Speaks word

    deactivate C
    deactivate T
```

This sequence diagram details the process of a user drawing what they want to speak and then SmartSpeech recognizing and speaking the word through the device. This is the main functionality of SmartSpeech.

1. User opens the app on their device
2. User draws a picture of what they want to say on the drawing pad
3. User is prompted with a list of suggestions describing their drawing
5. Drawing is correctly recognized, so User taps the corresponding tile on the screen
6. Word is spoken using the speaker on the device



## Use Case 2: *Image Drawing* - Edit Drawing
**User wants to draw a picture to help them communicate, but then changes their drawing after they come up with a different way to draw it.**

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    actor U as User
    participant C as Canvas
    participant T as Tiles
    participant RH as RecognizeHandler
    participant AR as Amazon Rekognition

    activate C
    activate T
    
    loop while drawing
        U->>C: Draws
        C->>RH: Automatically Sends drawing
        activate RH
        RH->>+AR: Sends drawing
        AR->>AR: Recognizes drawing
        AR-->>-RH: Suggests objects
        RH-->>T: Displays suggestions
        deactivate RH
    end

    U->>C: Presses clear canvas

    loop while drawing
        U->>C: Draws
        C->>RH: Automatically Sends drawing
        activate RH
        RH->>+AR: Sends drawing
        AR->>AR: Recognizes drawing
        AR-->>-RH: Suggests objects
        RH-->>T: Displays suggestions
        deactivate RH
    end
    
    U->>T: Presses suggestion
    T-->>U: Speaks word

    deactivate C
    deactivate T
```

This sequence diagram details the process of clearing the drawing pad when the word the user wants to speak is either not recognized or they want to portray it in a different way. This showcases the clear drawing pad function.

1. User opens the app on their device
2. User begins to draw a picture of what they want to say on the drawing pad
3. User clicks the clear canvas button to redraw the picture
4. User redraws the picture
5. User is prompted with a list of suggestions describing their drawing
6. Drawing is correctly recognized, so User taps the corresponding tile on the screen
7. Word is spoken using the speaker on the device



## Use Case 3: *AAC Board* - Add Custom Tiles
**User wants to add custom tile to their tile board.**

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    actor U as User
    participant H as Home
    participant TB as TileBoard
    participant C as Canvas
    participant T as TileData
    participant TH as TilesHandler
    participant A as AuthenticationService

    activate H

    U->>H: Enters username and password
    U->>H: Presses login
    H->>A: Verify credentials
    activate A
    A->>H: 200 OK
    deactivate A
    U->>TB: Navigates to tile board
    activate TB
    deactivate H
    U->>TB: Presses custom tile button
    TB->>C: Instantiate Canvas
    activate C
    U->>C: Draws image or uploads pictures
    C->>T: Registers image
    activate T

    U->>TB: Records sound
    TB->>T: Registers sound

    U->>TB: Presses save
    TB->>T: Saves tile

    T->>TH: Upload data
    activate TH
    TH->>TH: Write to Database
    TH->>T: 200 OK

    deactivate TH
    deactivate TB
    deactivate T
    deactivate C
```

This sequence diagram details the process of adding a custom tile to a user's SmartSpeech account. Custom tiles are helpful in increasing the efficacy of AAC solutions.

1. User opens the app on their device
2. User logs in to their account
3. User presses the tile board button on the main screen
4. User presses the create custom tile button
5. User enters a drawing or picture to be displayed on the tile
6. User enters a voice recording to go with the tile
7. User presses the save button to save their new custom tile

 

## Use Case 4: *AAC Board* - Use Tile Board
**User knows where to locate their word on the tile board, so they switch to that page.**

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    actor U as User
    participant H as Home
    participant TB as TileBoard
    participant T as Tile
    participant A as AuthenticationService

    U->>H: Enters username and password
    activate H

    U->>H: Presses login
    H->>A: Verify credentials
    activate A
    A->>H: 200 OK
    deactivate A
    U->>TB: Navigates to tile board
    deactivate H
    activate TB
    
    U->>TB: Presses category word belongs to
    TB->>T: Displays Tile
    activate T
    
    U->>T: Presses tile
    T->>U: Word is spoken
    deactivate T

    deactivate TB
```

This sequence diagram details the process of a user searching through the tile board in order to find the word they want to speak. This function is designed as a back up to the drawing pad.

1. User presses the tile board button on the main screen
2. User taps the category their word belongs to 
3. User taps the tile corresponding to their word on the screen
4. Word is spoken using the speaker on the device



## Use Case 5: *Image Recognition & Drawing* - Draw Rather Than Using Tiles
**User does not know where to locate their word on the tile board, so they draw it instead.**

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    actor U as User
    participant H as Home
    participant TB as TileBoard
    participant A as AuthenticationService
    participant C as Canvas
    participant T as Tiles
    participant RH as RecognizeHandler
    participant AR as Amazon Rekognition

    U->>H: Enters username and password
    activate H

    U->>H: Presses login
    H->>A: Verify credentials
    activate A
    A->>H: 200 OK
    deactivate A
    U->>TB: Navigates to tile board
    deactivate H
    activate TB
    
    U->>TB: Presses category word belongs to

    U->>H: Returns to home
    activate H

    H->>C: Instantiates Canvas

    activate C
    activate T
    
    loop while drawing
        U->>C: Draws
        C->>RH: Automatically Sends drawing
        activate RH
        RH->>+AR: Sends drawing
        AR->>AR: Recognizes drawing
        AR-->>-RH: Suggests objects
        RH-->>T: Displays suggestions
        deactivate RH
    end
    
    U->>T: Presses suggestion
    T-->>U: Speaks word

    deactivate C
    deactivate T

    deactivate H

    deactivate TB
```

This sequence diagram details and highlights the intuitive function of a user drawing what they want to speak on SmartSpeech instead of finding the word in the tile menues. This highlights the defining function of SmartSpeech compared to current AAC solutions that require the use of tile menues.

1. User presses tile board button on the main screen
2. User taps the category they think their word belongs to 
3. User is unable to find the word tile they want to use, so they return to the main screen
4. User draws a picture of what they want to say on the drawing pad
5. User is prompted with a list of suggestions describing their drawing
6. Drawing is correctly recognized, so User taps the corresponding tile on the screen
7. Word is spoken using the speaker on the device

1. User opens the app
2. User begins to draw what they want to say but lose connection to the internet
3. User is notified of the disconnection by an icon, and the drawing board disconnects
4. User navigates the manual tile board 
5. User taps the category their word belongs to 
6. User taps the tile corresponding to their word on the screen
