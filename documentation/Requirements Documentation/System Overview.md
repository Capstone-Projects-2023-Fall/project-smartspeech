# System Overview  
  
## Project Abstract  
  
AAC (augmentative and alternative communication) apps are alternative communication interfaces that allow non-verbal individuals to express themselves via TTS (text-to-speech). Nevertheless, many of these applications pose significant usability challenges, often necessitating extensive training and even the presence of a Speech-Language Pathologist (SLP) for user guidance. This problem is further compounded by educators lacking proper training in assisting AAC users[^1]. Numerous studies have underscored the critical role of instructor training as a major obstacle to the success of AAC. Moreover, the financial burden associated with AAC tools presents a substantial hurdle, as these devices are costly and typically cannot be taken home for continued training.  
  
SmartSpeech aims to resolve these issues by altering the AAC experience with Machine Learning (ML) and Image Recognition. Currently, the primary deterrent for AAC apps is having to navigate very complex menus to get to relevant words. The proposed solution includes a drawing canvas where a user can draw the item they wish to represent and a ML model would suggest related items to say. This will eliminate complex menu navigation and reduce training times. In addition to drawing recognition, the Progressive Web App (PWA) will be able to access camera. This ability will enable SmartSpeech to scan for objects to suggest on the app further reducing the time it takes to form a sentence.
